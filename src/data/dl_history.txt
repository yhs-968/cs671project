The term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986,[23][4] and Artificial Neural Networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons.[24] In 2005, Faustino Gomez and JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber published a paper on learning deep POMDPs[25] through neural networks for reinforcement learning. In 2006, a publication by Geoff Hinton, Osindero and Teh[26][27] showed how a many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then fine-tuning it using supervised backpropagation.[28] The paper referred to learning for deep belief nets. A Google Ngram chart shows that the usage of the term has increased since 2000.[29]
